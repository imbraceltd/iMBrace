<h1 align="center">iMBrace — Open-Source Enterprise AI OS</h1>

iMBrace Community Edition is a self-hosted, open-source AI Operating System built to keep your
company's intellectual property strictly on your infrastructure.

It gives developers and technical teams a transparent foundation to deploy context-aware AI
agents, stateful DAG workflows, and native MCP tool integrations—without sending sensitive
enterprise data to third-party clouds. Connect your local knowledge bases, route private LLMs,
and automate complex processes. When deployed with self-hosted models and storage, your data
stays inside your own environment. (Optional external providers such as OpenAI or Tavily, if
configured, send data outside your infrastructure.)

## Key Capabilities

- **Data Sovereignty & Local Context:** Ingest unstructured data into local vector stores. Your
  intellectual property stays behind your firewall.
- **AI Agent Builder:** Deploy role-based agents powered by local LLMs (Ollama/vLLM) or private
  API endpoints with complete prompt transparency.
- **Stateful DAG Workflow Engine:** Orchestrate multi-step AI tasks, scheduled triggers, and
  communication webhooks over predictable execution paths.
- **Native MCP Gateway:** Expose internal tools, databases, and custom Python/Node scripts to
  agents using open Model Context Protocol standards.
- **Local System Telemetry:** Track execution paths, token consumption, and node latency in
  real-time. Export logs to Grafana/Prometheus.
- **Enterprise-Scale AI:** Scale beyond Community Edition with hybrid RAG and SQL, agent
  orchestration, enterprise access control, governance and auditability, multi-organization
  management, AI Copilot, and professional support.

## Quick start — run iMBrace with Docker Compose

The whole stack is one file: [`deploy/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/docker-compose.yml) —
21 containers plus 10 one-shot jobs (9 DB inits and the example seed), all from public
`docker.io/imbraceco` images and official base images (`amd64` + `arm64`, no registry token).

### ⚠️ Default credentials — change them before exposing the stack

Every value below ships as a fixed default, so **every install shares it until you change it**.

| Credential | Default | Where to change it |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard admin login | `admin@imbrace.co` / `ChangeMe@12345` | In the UI after first login (seeded once via `NEW_ORG_PASSWORD`) |
| Postgres superuser + `imbrace` role | `changeme-postgres-pass` | `.env` → `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — **before the first start** (afterwards it needs an `ALTER ROLE`) |
| Redis | `imbrace-dev-redis-pass` | `.env` → `REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| chat-ai | `imbrace2026` / fixed key | compose → `ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY`, `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY` |
| ai-agent → chat-ai service key | `oss-dociq-key` | `.env` → `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` (lets ai-agent read unmasked LLM provider keys) |
| Garage S3 | fixed `rpc_secret` | compose → config `garage-config` |

The Workflow keys `AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (encrypts stored connection credentials) and
`AP_JWT_SECRET` (signs Workflow tokens) have **no default**: `docker compose up` refuses to
start until they are in `.env`, and `sh generate-env.sh` creates a random pair per install.

`docker compose down -v` deletes all data volumes irreversibly — back up `pgdata` first.

### Requirements

Runs on **Linux** (`amd64` / `arm64`) and **macOS** (Apple Silicon or Intel) — every image
is multi-arch, so Apple Silicon runs natively without emulation.

| | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | Docker Engine 24+ with **Compose v2.23.1+** | Docker Desktop, OrbStack or Colima with **Compose v2.23.1+** |
| Resources | Recommended **8 cores / 24 GB RAM / 100 GB SSD** | Same, but given to Docker's VM: **Settings → Resources**, at least 16–24 GB memory and a 100 GB disk image (the defaults are too small) |
| Commands | Prefix `docker` with `sudo` unless your user is in the `docker` group | No `sudo` |
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | The server's IP or domain | `localhost` for this Mac only, or its LAN IP (`ipconfig getifaddr en0`) for other machines — then allow Docker in the macOS firewall |

- The stack idles at ~7.5 GB RAM; too little RAM shows up as OOM-kills or a frozen host,
  not as a clear error.
- Inbound ports `6868`, `30700`, `30040`, `30030`, `30050`.
- No GPU: AI features use an **external** OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (`VLLM_URL` / `LLM_PROVIDER` on `chat-ai` and `ai-agent`).
- On a Mac used as a server, disable sleep — the stack stops while the Mac sleeps.

### Deploy

The same commands work in a Linux shell and in the macOS Terminal (bash or zsh).

```bash
mkdir imbrace && cd imbrace
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbrace-co/iMBrace/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbrace-co/iMBrace/main/deploy/generate-env.sh

# First install only: random database passwords. The [ -f .env ] guard keeps an existing
# .env, because a new POSTGRES_PASSWORD no longer matches the initialized database.
[ -f .env ] || cat > .env <<EOF
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
EOF
sh generate-env.sh              # adds random AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY / AP_JWT_SECRET to .env

docker compose pull
docker compose up -d            # first start takes ~5 min
```

`PUBLIC_HOST` defaults to `localhost`: on the machine running the stack, open the dashboard
at `http://localhost:6868` or `http://127.0.0.1:6868`. The chat widget's full page
(`:30050/full_page.html`) has to be opened with the `PUBLIC_HOST` name itself, because its
iframe points there — to use `127.0.0.1` for it (or where `localhost` resolves to IPv6
first), set `PUBLIC_HOST=127.0.0.1`. To reach the stack from other machines, add the IP or
domain browsers use (no scheme, no port) to `.env` before `up`, e.g.
`echo PUBLIC_HOST=10.0.0.5 >> .env`.

Startup order is encoded in the file, so one `up -d` is enough. Back up `.env`: losing
`AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` makes stored Workflow connections unrecoverable.

> **Upgrading an install made from an earlier `docker-compose.yml`?** Do not run
> `generate-env.sh` — copy the `AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AP_JWT_SECRET` values from your old
> file into `.env` instead, so existing connections still decrypt.

### Verify

```bash
docker compose ps               # *-db-init jobs: Exited (0); everything else: Up / healthy

curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@imbrace.co","password":"ChangeMe@12345"}' \
  http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:6868/api/platform/v1/login/authenticate     # returns a token
```

| URL | Content |
|---|---|
| `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:6868` | Dashboard + `/api` gateway |
| `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:30700` | Workflow automation |
| `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:30040` | AI agent (Next Best Action) |
| `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:30030` | insightIQ AI chat |
| `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:30050` | Embeddable chat widget |

### Try the example: two workflows that work together

The first `up -d` also installs the **customer-request** example
([`examples/customer-request`](examples/customer-request)): the one-shot `examples-seed`
service imports and enables two flows, and `customer-request-stub` (on `127.0.0.1:30800`)
stands in for the customer and the business system.

| Flow (FlowOps → Workflows) | Started by | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer request - intake** | a service request with a `request_id` | An AI agent classifies it, a code step finds the missing fields, the customer is asked for them, then the run **waits** (*Wait for Event*, key = `request_id`). After the reply it creates an approval task on the **Todos** page and, once approved, calls the business system. |
| **Customer request - reply router** | the customer's reply with the same `request_id` | *Resume Waiting Run*, key = `request_id`: hands the reply to the intake run waiting on that id, which carries on, and answers `202 resumed` — or `404 no waiting request` when no run waits on it. |

The `request_id` is the only link between the two flows. The waiting run is stored in
Postgres (no polling), so it survives `docker compose restart`, and a second reply for the
same id gets a `404` instead of resuming the run twice.

```
request ─► intake: classify ─ check fields ─ ask customer ─ ⏸ wait (request_id) ···▶ approval ⏸ ···▶ business system
reply ───► reply router: resume the run waiting on request_id ─────┘   (202 resumed / 404 nothing waiting)
```

**1. Give the example an AI model.** Dashboard → **LLM Provider** → add a provider (the
example is tested with Amazon Bedrock; for another type set `CLASSIFIER_PROVIDER_TYPE` /
`CLASSIFIER_MODEL` in `.env` first). Within 30 seconds the seed creates the AI agent
*Customer Request Classifier*, points the intake flow at it and exits:

```bash
docker compose logs examples-seed     # last line: "customer-request example is ready"
```

**2. Run both flows** — in the folder with `docker-compose.yml`, from bash, zsh, cmd or
PowerShell; nothing to install besides Docker. Use the same `request_id` in every step:

```bash
docker compose run --rm examples request REQ-1001   # intake: prints "Information required ..." and the AI classification; the run now waits
docker compose run --rm examples reply   REQ-1001   # reply router: HTTP 202 "resumed" (again: 404, nothing waits any more)
docker compose run --rm examples approve REQ-1001   # or Todos page → "Approve service request REQ-1001" → Mark as Approve
docker compose run --rm examples result  REQ-1001   # what the business system received: request, reply, classification, approval — one run_id
```

FlowOps → Workflows → **Runs** shows the intake run (*Paused* while it waits) with the
input and output of every step, and one reply router run per reply. `approve REQ-1001 Reject`
takes the rejection path instead.

To call the webhooks yourself, `docker compose run --rm examples urls` prints both URLs.
Send JSON with `content-type: application/json`: the request needs `request_id` (the example
treats `customer_name`, `email`, `address` and `preferred_date` as required), the reply the same
`request_id` plus the missing fields; add `/sync` to the reply router URL to get its
`202` / `404` answer. `SEED_EXAMPLES=false` in `.env` skips the example. More (bash scripts,
acceptance test, editing the flows): [`examples/customer-request/README.md`](examples/customer-request/README.md).

### Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | `localhost` | Browser-facing IP/domain. Unset: use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on the same machine (`127.0.0.1` for the widget full page needs `PUBLIC_HOST=127.0.0.1`) — **required** for any other machine |
| `PUBLIC_SCHEME` / `WS_SCHEME` | `http` / `ws` | Set `https` / `wss` behind a TLS proxy |
| `AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `AP_JWT_SECRET` | none — **required** | Workflow keys, written by `sh generate-env.sh` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `changeme-postgres-pass` | Postgres superuser and app role |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | `imbrace-dev-redis-pass` | Redis auth |
| `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` | `oss-dociq-key` | Shared by ai-agent and chat-ai; other callers only see masked LLM provider keys |
| `SEED_EXAMPLES` | `true` | `false` skips installing the example workflows |
| `CLASSIFIER_PROVIDER_TYPE` / `CLASSIFIER_MODEL` | `bedrock` / `qwen.qwen3-32b-v1:0` | LLM provider type and model of the example's AI agent |
| `GARAGE_KEY_ID` / `GARAGE_KEY_SECRET` | empty | Garage S3 keys (optional bootstrap in the compose header) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `TAVILY_API_KEY` | empty | Optional external providers |

### Operate

```bash
docker compose logs -f <service>
docker compose up -d            # after editing the file — only changed services restart
docker compose down             # stop, keep data
```

## Working on the code

Each repository is self-contained and has its own README with setup instructions. Clone
the component you want to work on and follow its local README. A typical on-prem stack is
composed of the backend services above plus `imbrace-fe`.

[`deploy/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/docker-compose.yml) pins the currently published image
tag of every component, so it doubles as the reference for which versions are known to work
together. To run your own build of one service against the rest of the stack, drop a
`docker-compose.override.yml` next to it — Compose merges it automatically:

```yaml
services:
  data-board:
    image: my-local/data_board:dev
```
